# Growth Diary App

## Overview
A practical tool for self-taught developers. It keeps you on track by logging your learning sessions, analyzing productivity, and highlighting areas for improvement. It's not about flashy promises but genuine support for a more effective and mindful learning journey.

## Problem statement
As a self-taught developer without a traditional CS/SWE degree, having an enforced curriculum could have helped me
stay focused and efficient. Without such constraints, I would often sink countless hours towards 
a topic without stepping back to reflect on I was making the best use of my time. 

While investing time into this field is a given, I believe that it is possible to study smarter and not just harder.

## The solution

The Growth Diary App was thus created to provide a means to keep track of my learning progress. This reflective process
would help me identify areas to improve on in order to enhance my learning efficiency.
To achieve these, the app provides the following features:

## Key Features
1. `Session Tracker`: 
* Provides means to track a learning session in real-time, or record a previous session.
* Tracks the topic being learnt, when it started, how long it went for, how productive it was and obstacles faced

2. `Session History`:
* Presents a view of all learning sessions
* Allows for sorting by topic, dates, duration and productivity
* Filters across various session aspects
* Pagination for better readability

3. `Session Analytics`:
* Provides a quick breakdown on most worked on topic, most faced obstacle, total time spend learning, average duration per session
and average productivity per session
* Displays a simple chart to track correlations between productivity and session obstacles, duration or time periods
