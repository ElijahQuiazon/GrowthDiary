# ðŸŒ± Growth Diary App

## Overview
Growth Diary is a simple tool for effective self-paced learning, offering session tracking, filterable views, and productivity analysis for a reflective development journey.

## Problem Statement
Self-taught developers, particularly those without a traditional CS/SWE degree, might often find themselves overthinking, jumping between tutorials, or spending too much time on a single topic. Time is valuable, and it becomes important to maximize learning time. 

## The Solution

The Growth Diary App was developed to empower self-taught developers with a reflective tool to keep track and analyze their learning sessions. The tool offers insights that will allow developers to reflect on studying habits â€” and ultimately learn to study smarter and not just harder.

## Key Features
1. **ðŸš€ Session Tracker**: 
   - Track learning sessions in real-time or record past ones.
   - Capture topic, start time, duration, productivity, and obstacles faced.

2. **ðŸ“š Session History**:
   - View all learning sessions easily.
   - Sort by topic, dates, duration, and productivity.
   - Apply filters for focused insights.
   - Enjoy hassle-free pagination.

3. **ðŸ“Š Session Analytics**:
   - Get quick insights on top topics, common obstacles, total learning time, and averages.
   - Visualize correlations with a simple chart.
